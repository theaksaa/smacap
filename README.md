# SMAcap
Not the first of its kind, with the unique design SMAcap, represents the aid to blind persons. It uses ultrasonic technology combined with math to help them orient in space. The SMAcap uses three ultrasonic sensors so it can sense and warn in the 180-degree range. With the long battery life, a person shouldn't worry much about the cap losing energy. It can easily withstand a few days. Simple to use easy to set up, it uses only one button to configure everything, from power to calibration. When you power it, it will automatically adjust itself to meet the holder's requirements. The front sensor is attached to the servo so it can move and warn the owner in case something is found in front of him, so there shouldn't be a blind spot. The object distance is expressed through person's steps which are carefully measured during the calibration. The 3.5mm jack enables the owner to choose a preferred playback device although we suggest speaker usage because it gives the person a sense of the environment.  While SMAcap is only a prototype it has great potential and his first purpose is to share the awareness about the blind.
